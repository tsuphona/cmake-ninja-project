## CMake
*"CMake is an extensible, open-source system that manages the build process in an operating system and in a compiler-independent manner. Unlike many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the native build environment. Simple configuration files placed in each source directory (called CMakeLists.txt files) are used to generate standard build files (e.g., makefiles on Unix and projects/workspaces in Windows MSVC) which are used in the usual way."*

### Install CMake
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
$ wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.24.1/cmake-3.24.1.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf cmake-3.24.1.tar.gz
$ cd cmake-3.24.1
$ ./bootstrap && make && sudo make install
```

## Ninja
*"Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible."*

### Install Ninja
```bash
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
```
